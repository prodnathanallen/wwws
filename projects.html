            <p><i>Keep Still</i> is Dogwood's debut album. Dogwood is Ethan Cantrell and friends. Ethan is a musician, a writer, a producer, and an engineer. He draws on his relationships and daily life, writing songs with all kinds of expression, emotion, confessions, inventive rhythms, melodies, and harmony. Keep Still was recorded at my home, in the summer of 2024. Overdubs took place all over Bloomington, up to release on April 3, 2025. <g>[production, engineering, mix, master]</g></p>

            <p><i>Slug Rug</i> is Slug Rug's third release, the first with their current lineup. Slug Rug is Audrey and Keegan Priest, Reeder Vyain, Ethan Cantrell, and Drew Goforth. This three-track EP spans the breadth of Slug Rug's stylings. "Lighter Fluid" is catchy and upbeat, "Oh Man" is sprawling and massive, and "Teenage Symphony" closes the EP with a full-bodied beat. <i>Slug Rug</i> was recorded at my home and at Ali's — a friend. <i>Slug Rug</i> was released on March 28, 2025. <g>[production, engineering, mixing, mastering]</g></p>

            <p><i>What's Ahead is Behind Me</i> is Prairie Scout's debut album. Prairie Scout started as the solo project of singer-songwriter Natalie Ingalls and grew to the current band composed of Julia Fegelman (bass), Wesley Davis (drums) and John Hasey (guitar). Influenced lyrically and sonically by folk-pop icon Vashti Bunyan, contemporaries like Wednesday and feeble little horse and the odd science fiction story, Prairie Scout puts their own spin on indie rock. <i>What's Ahead is Behind Me</i> was released on January 31, 2025. <g>[co-production, engineering, mastering]</g></p>

            <img src="images/albums/brick.png">
            <p><i>Upanatem</i> is Brick Lancaster's debut album. Brick Lancaster is Reeder Vyain, supported by me (bass, guitar), Ethan Cantrell (drums), Keegan Priest (guitar), and Ben Wilck (guitar, backing vocals). Reeder and I have been friends since elementary school, and we've worked together on music since high school. In college, we've made three albums, <i>Upanatem</i> is our latest. Reeder and I recorded <i>Upanatem</i> in the third bedroom and the living room of our house, in Bloomington, IN. We recorded to 1/2" 8-track, using 2 2500' reels as we had significant overdubs, and I wanted to archive various things along the way. Reeder and I think of the process as him coming to me with the riffs, an arrangement, and some lead lines, and I play the first thing that comes to mind. He and I are far enough along in producing together that we are able to be clear about what we don't like, and typically, there is little debate. Cut, add, modify, whatever needs to happen, then we move on. <i>Upanatem</i> was released on December 6, 2024.<g> [production, engineering, mix, master]</g></p>
