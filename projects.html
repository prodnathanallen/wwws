            <p>"June, July" is Just Penelope's debut single. Just Penelope is the Bloomington, Indiana-based indie grunge trio of Ella Curiel, Ethan Cantrell, and Drew Goforth. As of writing, Just Penelope is the latest signing to Fire Talk Records' imprint <b>Angel Tapes</b>. "The trio first connected at Indiana University’s cherished Jacobs School of Music, and quickly cut their teeth in the bubbling midwest scene. Well-studied in rock that moves the spirit and the body, Just Penelope have built a reputation in their finely-honed blend of indie, alternative country, and melodic shoegaze. Alongside the news of their signing, Just Penelope unveil their debut single, “June, July,” and their first-ever music video." <i><g>copy by Fire Talk Records.</g></i> June, July was recorded at my home, in the Spring of 2025.<g>[production, engineering, mix, master]</g></p>

            <p><i>Slug Rug</i> is Slug Rug's third release, the first with their current lineup. Slug Rug is Audrey and Keegan Priest, Reeder Vyain, Ethan Cantrell, and Drew Goforth. This three-track EP spans the breadth of Slug Rug's stylings.

            <p><i>What's Ahead is Behind Me</i> is Prairie Scout's debut album. Prairie Scout started as the solo project of singer-songwriter Natalie Ingalls and grew to the current band composed of Julia Fegelman (bass), Wesley Davis (drums) and John Hasey (guitar). Influenced lyrically and sonically by folk-pop icon Vashti Bunyan, contemporaries like Wednesday and feeble little horse and the odd science fiction story, Prairie Scout puts their own spin on indie rock. <i>What's Ahead is Behind Me</i> was released on January 31, 2025. <g>[co-production, engineering, mastering]</g></p>

            <p><i>Upanatem</i> is Brick Lancaster's debut album. Brick Lancaster is Reeder Vyain, supported by me (bass, guitar), Ethan Cantrell (drums), Keegan Priest (guitar), and Ben Wilck (guitar, backing vocals). Reeder and I have been friends since elementary school, and we've worked together on music since high school. In college, we've made three albums, <i>Upanatem</i> is our latest. Reeder and I recorded <i>Upanatem</i> in the third bedroom and the living room of our house, in Bloomington, IN. We recorded to 1/2" 8-track, using 2 2500' reels as we had significant overdubs, and I wanted to archive various things along the way. Reeder and I think of the process as him coming to me with the riffs, an arrangement, and some lead lines, and I play the first thing that comes to mind. He and I are far enough along in producing together that we are able to be clear about what we don't like, and typically, there is little debate. Cut, add, modify, whatever needs to happen, then we move on. <i>Upanatem</i> was released on December 6, 2024.<g> [production, engineering, mix, master]</g></p>
