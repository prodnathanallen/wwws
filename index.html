          <p>I'm Nathan, a midwest-based Recording Engineer and Producer focused on albums, indie bands, and capturing performances.</p>

          <p>Over the past few years, I’ve worked with a variety of musicians, in genres such as shoe-gaze, indie rock, singer-songwriter, and freak folk.</p>

          <p>I owe my love for music to my childhood experience in a guitar shop, taking lessons. In college, I've played in various bands, and for countless recording sessions.</p>

          <p>My recording background began when I was a teenager, and I've been recording since. Much of my ideology and techniques are reinforced by my education in analog electronics. I tech my own equipment, and I've worked as a tech for Primary Sound Studios.</p>

          <p>I'm proficient in Pro Tools, and I have the capability to record to tape, owning and maintaining a Tascam 85-16b 16-track 1" recorder, and a Tascam TSR-8 8-track 1/2" recorder. I have my own gear, and I am interested in recording in other studios. I am confident recording in any studio.</p>

          <p>I love making things. I am a photographer, and I practice other hobbies like woodworking, web design, and fixing things.</p>
