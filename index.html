          <p>I'm Nathan, a midwest-based Recording Engineer and Producer focused on albums, bands, and capturing performances.</p>

          <p>Recently, I’ve worked with a variety of musicians, in genres such as shoegaze, indie rock, singer-songwriter, and freak folk.</p>

          <p>I owe my love for music to my childhood experiences in a guitar shop, taking lessons. In college, I've played in various bands, and for countless recording sessions.</p>

          <p>My recording background began when I was a teenager, and I've been recording since. Much of my ideology and processes are reinforced by my education in analog electronics. I tech my own equipment, and I've worked as a studio tech.</p>

          <p>I'm proficient in Pro Tools, and I record to tape. I own and maintain a Tascam 85-16b 16-track 1" recorder, and a Tascam TSR-8 8-track 1/2" recorder. I work primarily from my studio, studios on the Indiana University Bloomington campus, and Bloomington's Primary Sound Studios. I am confident recording in any studio.</p>

          <p>I love making things. I am a photographer, and I practice other hobbies like woodworking, web design, and fixing things.</p>
